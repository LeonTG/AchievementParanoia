# AchievementParanoia

**Scenario idea by:** [319phoenix](https://www.reddit.com/u/319phoenix)

**Description:**

Achievements show up in chat like in vanilla minecraft but at the end off each achievement it shows the coordinates of the player who earned that achievement.

In this plugin it's not the EXACT same as vanilla, but it says the achievement, who got it and where so it's good enough
